      <h4>A time you got blocked on a simple problem and a time when you
        solved a problem in an elegant way.</h4>
      <p>
        A recent example was the other day. I was trying to upload one of my react projects to github but could not get
        gh-pages to display the react app properly. In the end, the problem ended up being that my homepage link in my
        package.json file was not the same as my gh-pages link. It took the good part of a day to fix that problem, only
        to realize I was using the wrong URL.

        The problem solving technique I used was first decomposing the problem into questions. What is gh-pages? How
        does it work? What does it do? Do I push my work to gh-pages or main? After understanding most of the answers, I
        finally realized that the homepage link was incorrect.

        I felt increasingly agitated and even angry while trying to figure out why it doesn't work. I remember telling
        my flatmate how stupid I thought gh-pages seemed and how github as a whole doesn't seem very user friendly,
        especially to those new to the field. I ate my words when I realized it was my fault.

        I learnt that StackOverflow is truly a gift from the gods.

      <p>
        A time when I solved a problem in an elegant way was when I was asked to tidy up some code inside VSCode as a
        challenge. I simply highlighted the document and pressed alt+shift+f. I understand the challenge wanted me to
        understand 'neat' code, but I quite enjoyed turning an arduous task into a simple one by using the shortcut.

        I felt a bit cheeky taking a shortcut, but I learnt that some challenges can be fixed easily through using built
        in functions or shortcuts.

      <h4>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:
      </h4>
      <p>
        Console.logging - amazing. I love console.log. Its a great way of deconstructing problems. Why is my function
        returning undefined? Time to console.log everything inside my function. Good times. Love it. Console.log("love
        this").
      </p>
      <p>
        Googling - great. I google everything from rashes to cooking recipes. Google is a one way ticket to StackOverflow and M3. Even better. Great stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asking your peers for help - eh. Even asking a full stack developer (my flatmate) can kind of lead to more confusion. I do appreciate how he breaks down everything in my code and asks me to explain what each part does. Sometimes I don't even know. In terms of my cohort I haven't asked them anything yet. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Improving your process with reflection - if something works, then I'll do my best to reflect on why it worked. If something isn't working, then it is great to also reflect and break it down into smaller chunks. Love me some reflecting. Nice.
      </p>
