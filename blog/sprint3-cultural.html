      <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
      <p>Emotional intelligence is defined as "The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to
        handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically." To me, Emotional Intelligence involves
        listening, understand, empathizing and compassion. </p>
      <h4>Why is Emotional Intelligence useful?</h4>
      <p>Emotional Intelligence is a valuable skill in the workplace. According to <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Goleman" target="_blank">Daniel Goleman</a>, one of the 'founders
        of the era of Emotional Intelligence', suggest that Emotional Intelligence is twice as important in one's
        workplace as IQ. Think of a a time you've gone to school or work and felt low due to a personal event. Would you
        rather begin working on a project with someone who may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but says "I know
        you're going through a hard time, so let me know if you need any support" or someone who is competent but says
        "You're pretty late. We've got a lot to get done. Don't do that again." In most cases, you'd want the person who
        is understanding and empathetic to be your partner.
      </p>
      <h4>How can I improve my Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
      <p>Various methods can be used to practice being mindful and in turn, improve your Emotional Intelligence.

        One exercise I am fond of from this course is conscious listening. Find a partner and set a timer for two
        minutes. Listen to your partner talk about something for two minutes. After they are finished, try and recap
        what the other person has said and check that you understand what they felt, and the points they wanted to get
        across.
      </p>
      <p>It may seem simple, but actively listening in conversations instead of waiting for your turn to speak can lead
        to stronger bonds between you and your peers. That's not to say you should be silent during a conversation. The perfect conversation should be a 50/50 split between talking and listening. I
        know that I sometimes drift out of conversations and begin daydreaming, but if you make a conscious effort to
        just listen and understand another person, you'd be surprised at how long your attention span really is. If you notice someone is mostly silent during a conversation, try and ask them a question and take the time to listen for a minute or so. The shy person in your group may in fact be a genius. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To take the concept of being mindful even further, you can practice meditation. Personally, I found the 'Waking
        Up' app by Sam Harris to be really effective. Spend 5 to 10 minutes each day practicing meditation and breathing
        exercises. After ten or so sessions, you'll be surprised at how much you can appreciate your senses on a surface
        level.
        This can also be practiced in a conversation. Instead of turning your attention to your senses, simply switch
        between being active and being an observer of the conversation.
