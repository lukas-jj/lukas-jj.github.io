        <h2 class="entry-header">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</h2>

        <p>
          I would like to use a very simple example of an ethical problem I faced and how I used decomposition to break
          it down. I have dabbled in both veganism and
          vegetarianism from an early age. One of my good friends is a vegan, and during one of our walks she
          asked me why I drink cow's milk. I was well aware that
          drinking cow's milk lead to a lot of suffering. So, I figured that I wanted to make the ethical decision
          as to whether or not I should continue drinking dairy milk.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to use the method of decomposing the question into smaller questions.

        <ul>
          <li><b>Why do I drink milk?</b> I like the
            taste, it's relatively good for you and it is very versatile in cooking and meal prep.
          </li>
          <li> <b>Why do I buy cow's
              milk?</b>
            It's cheap and... I guess I just always have.
          </li>
          <li><b> What problems would I face if I switched to soy milk?</b></li> I did some research and found out soy
          milk can be even cheaper than cows milk, is high in protein and contains half of the fat of soy milk.
          It also tastes kind of like weet-bix. There wouldn't be a problem.
          </li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <p>Even though this is a simple and perhaps rather mundane example, it demonstrates how I try and use
          decomposition to solve
          problems. I try and use this train of thought in all aspects of life. When I'm studying or working on a
          project
          and
          I hit a wall, I find it extremely useful to reduce the problem into smaller pieces or questions.

        <h4 class="entry-header">Ganbaru and Gaman.</h4>
        <p>
          During my time in Japan, I became greatly interested in the
          concepts of 'Ganbaru' (do your best, work your hardest) and 'Gaman' (patience and dignity). These concepts
          seem to have been around since the days of the Samurai. Often in a working environment, you will hear people
          say "Ganbatte kudasai" which
          translates to "Please, do the best you can". You will hear it when after you've been given a task at work, or
          when you're studying. I suppose the closest we have in English is
          "you can do it!" or "good luck!". However, neither of these seem to have the same compassion and sincerity as
          'Ganbatte'. The idea of 'Ganbaru' to me is that so long as you put all your effort into something and do your
          best, the
          outcome isn't important. Since leaving Japan, I try to think about the concept of putting your all into what
          you love. The outcome really doesn't matter, so long as you know you tried your best. My Dad used to always
          say: 'at the end of the day, there's only one person you need to impress.' I hope to incorporate these philosophies into my studies.

        <h4 class="entry-header">Six Months Street Performing in Europe.</h4>
        <p>
          As I was born in York, England and am half German, I have had the wonderful experience of growing up in both
          the UK and Germany. I also have a strong passion for music. From my time in high school through to university,
          I often dreamed of travelling around Europe with my guitar. The idea was to see how long I could sustain
          myself from playing music and visiting as many countries as possible. As soon as I
          graduated from university, I skipped the ceremony and headed straight to Germany. Long story short, I am proud
          to say I managed
          six months of living off of music and the kindness of strangers. I visited over 10 different countries, and by
          the time winter came around, I found myself in Dublin playing to crowds of people on Grafton Street. One
          morning, as I was playing on, I realized my hands were shaking. It was freezing cold and my hands were too
          sore to play. I
          figured it was time to return to New Zealand and call it a success. I believe that those six months of
          travelling alone shaped my values and identity so strongly that afterwards, I was more comfortable in my own
          skin than I ever had been before. Putting yourself outside of your comfort zone for the sake of fulfilling a
          dream is something I believe everyone should try once in their life. Otherwise, you'll be sitting there
          wishing you had.

      <p>
        My previous examples demonstrate my openness and why I consider it to be a strength. If I'm open to changing
        to soy milk to better myself, then why not constantly be open to small changes which may improve my life? If I'm
        open to putting myself out of my comfort zone for six months, why not try it every week? It seems to be that
        being open has lead me to being happier.
        The older I get and the more I travel, the more I meet new people and am exposed to new ideas. I love being
        proven
        wrong about something and learning new things. Bad experiences and failures are nothing to fear, but rather things to become curious about.
      </p>
      <p>
        A limitation to this approach is that sometimes I can be rather nonchalant about failure. For example, I find it
        difficult working with perfectionists and visionaries. If someone has a concrete idea about something, then they
        may not be open to criticism. I much prefer being around those willing to go back to the drawing board and try
        again, than being around those who persist until their vision is met.
