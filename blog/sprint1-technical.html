        <h2 class="entry-header">An Ethical Problem and how I faced it</h2>
        <p>
          I would like to use a very simple example of an ethical problem I faced and how I used decomposition to break
          it down. I have dabbled in both veganism and
          vegetarianism from an early age. One of my good friends is a vegan, and I noticed she always has soy milk. She
          asked me why I drink cow's milk, and whether or not I was aware of how unethical it is. I was aware that
          drinking cow's milk did lead to a lot of suffering. So, I had to make the ethical decison I had to make was
          whether or not I should continue drinking cow milk.

        </p>
        <p>
          So let's try and break down the problem I was facing into smaller questions. Why do I drink milk? I like the
          taste, it's relatively good for you and it is very versatile in cooking and meal prep. Why do I buy cows milk?
          It's cheap and... I guess I just always have. What problems would I face if I switched to soy milk? I did some
          research and
          found
          out soy milk can be even cheaper than cows milk, is high in protein and contains half of the fat of soy milk.
          It
          also tastes kind of like weet-bix. After breaking it all down, it was pretty clear to me that I don't need to
          consume cow's milk at all.
        </p>

        <p>Even though this is a simple and perhaps rather absurd example, it demonstrates how I try and use
          decomposition to solve
          problems. I try and use this train of thought in all aspects of life. When I'm studying or working on a
          project
          and
          I hit a wall, I find it extremely useful to reduce the problem into smaller pieces or questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This example demonstrates my openness and why I consider it to be a strength. Through my experiences
          travelling and living in different countries, it seems that we can learn a lot from other cultures so long as
          we are open to new ideas. Openness can also be a limitation however. For example, I sometimes find it hard
          working with people who are
          traditionalist and are more comfortable with the idea that "If it ain't broke, don't try fix it".
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of this was working at a high school in Japan. I often found the teaching curriculum to be rigid
          and opposed to change. I worked best with teachers who were open to new ideas and experimenting with learning
          styles. My favorite kinds of teachers faced rejection and failure with optimism, and rather than thinking
          "Well, let's just follow the textbook" offered criticisms such as "I like the idea, but perhaps we should try
          again in smaller groups so the students will feel more comfortable speaking to one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conflict arose when teachers wanted a class which followed the textbook and was hesitant to explore outside of
          the curriculum for more enjoyable and engaging activities. One example of this was teaching debate to a sports
          class. The textbook debate for that week was "Should bike rentals be encouraged in Japan?". I already knew
          from the title that it was a dull and rather boring debate. I thought, why not make it sports related? Perhaps
          debate something like mixed gender sports, or whether e-sports could be considered a sport. The teacher
          brushed off the suggestion without even offering a criticism. The textbook was "tried and tested". My working
          relationship with this particular teacher suffered as a result, and negatively impacted my energy in the
          classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          In hindsight, I could have decomposed the problem. Why was the teacher resistent to change? Why was the
          textbook "tried and tested"? Was there a way I could have made the topic more interesting? Would the teacher
          be interested in including more sports related topics in the future? Decomposing a problem like this can
          really help address smaller problems which I may not have been aware of. Perhaps the man wrote the textbook
          and I was being extremely.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what is the point of this blog entry? I suppose I want to highlight the value of being open, and the idea of decomposing problems so that you can fully understand situations before you tackle it head on and give up.
