        <h2 class="entry-header">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</h2>

        <p>
          I would like to use a very simple example of an ethical problem I faced and how I used decomposition to break
          it down. I have dabbled in both veganism and
          vegetarianism from an early age. One of my good friends is a vegan, and during one of our walks she
          asked me why I drink cow's milk. I was well aware that
          drinking cow's milk lead to a lot of suffering. So, I figure that I wanted to make the ethical decision
          whether or not I should continue drinking dairy milk.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to use the method of decomposing the question into smaller questions.

        <ul>
          <li><b>Why do I drink milk?</b> I like the
            taste, it's relatively good for you and it is very versatile in cooking and meal prep.
          </li>
          <li> <b>Why do I buy cow's
              milk?</b>
            It's cheap and... I guess I just always have.
          </li>
          <li><b> What problems would I face if I switched to soy milk?</b></li> I did some research and found out soy milk can be even cheaper than cows milk, is high in protein and contains half of the fat of soy milk.
          It also tastes kind of like weet-bix. There wouldn't be a problem.
          </li>
        </ul>After breaking it all down, it was pretty clear to me that I don't need
        to
        consume cow's milk at all.

        </p>

        <p>Even though this is a simple and perhaps rather absurd example, it demonstrates how I try and use
          decomposition to solve
          problems. I try and use this train of thought in all aspects of life. When I'm studying or working on a
          project
          and
          I hit a wall, I find it extremely useful to reduce the problem into smaller pieces or questions.

        <p>
          My previous example demonstrates my openness and why I consider it to be a strength. If I'm open to changing
          to soy milk to better myself, then why not constantly be open to small changes which may improve my life? The
          older I get and the more I travel, the more I meet new people and am exposed to new ideas. I love being proven
          wrong about something and having my whole world flipped.

        </p>
        <p>
          My interpretation of openness also means a willingness to fail and still persist. To some, being okay with failure is seen as a limitation. However, I usually find it hard
          working with those who go by the saying "If it ain't broke, don't try fix it".
          An example of this was working at a high school in Japan. I often found the teaching curriculum to be rigid
          and opposed to change. I worked best with teachers who faced rejection and failure with optimism, and rather than thinking
          "Well, let's never do that again", offered criticisms such as "I like the idea, but perhaps we should try
          again in smaller groups so the students will feel more comfortable speaking to one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conflict arose when I was paired with teachers who were hesitant to explore outside of
          the textbook. One example of this was teaching debate to a sports
          class. The textbook debate for that week was "Should bike rentals be encouraged in Japan?". I already knew
          from the title that it was a dull and rather boring debate. Why not make it sports related? Perhaps
          debate something like mixed gender sports, or whether e-sports could be considered a sport. The teacher
          brushed off the suggestion without even offering a criticism. The textbook was final. My working
          relationship with this particular teacher suffered as a result, and negatively impacted my energy in the
          classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          In hindsight, I could have decomposed the problem. Why was the teacher resistent to change? Was there a way I could have made the topic more interesting? Would the teacher
          be interested in including more sports related topics in the future? Decomposing a problem like this can
          really help address smaller problems which I may not have been aware of. Perhaps he wrote the textbook
          and I was being extremely rude.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what is the point of this blog entry? I suppose I want to highlight the value of being open, and to promote the idea of seeing failure as an obstacle which can be broken down into smaller, digestible pieces. I would like to be empathetic and open to change instead of stubborn and defeated by failure.
