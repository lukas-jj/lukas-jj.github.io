      <h4>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h4>
      <p>
        HTML is all the ingredients of a cake. CSS is the style and proportions of the cake and how it's presented. For example, maybe our cake is a chocolate spongecake. HTML would be the cake and it's ingredients. CSS would be what shape that cake was, what kind of coloring is added, how it is presented. 

        Both are equally important. If you were to observe a page of HTML without any styling (CSS), it would most likely look terribly bland. CSS we can move titles, create space, add color and even animations. You don't want to be presented a plain spongecake right?

      <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h4>
      <p>
        Say you've been neglecting your wardrobe for a while and it's a complete mess. Your t-shirts are laying around, questionably stained jumpers are crawling from the drawers and you can't remember if those jeans belong to you or your flatmate. If we were to tidy it all up, we'd be doing a loop of tidying.  We would loop this behavior until the task was completed. 
        The process would look something like:
       Pick up clothing - observe clothing - Is it clean? If yes, is it a shirt? If yes, put it on the hanger. Is it messy? Put it in the wash. 

       These are known as If statements which can be used within a loop. The loop would keep running until a condition is met, which would be that there are no more clothes laying around. The hierarchy of actions is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow">Control Flow</a>.

      <h4>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h4>
      <p>
        DOM stands for Document Object Model. It describes the structure of an HTML document. The document is the web page, usually referring to the HTML. Every element within the document is an object (Spans, divs, h1s etc). We can manipulate these objects using JavaScript. We can remove, add and change elements. 

        Nodes are anything we can change within an HTML document (objects). We can also change the text within elements, as they are seperate nodes. Html attributes are also nodes. For example, classes, styles or href attributes. 

        We can change these nodes and interact these nodes. For example, we can change the text within an element when you click on it.

      </p>
      <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h4>
      <p>

        A function in programming is a block of reuseable code that is used to perform an action. For example, if I have an array of numbers [1,2,3,4,5] and I wanted to create a new array with only odd numbers inside the array, I could write a function to do that. There are three parts to a function: input, process and output. 
        Using my example of sorting an array into odd numbers, the input would be the array, the process would be the calculation which separates odd numbers from even numbers, and the output would the new array which has all of the odd numbers inside. This function can be reused for any array that we put in. We could store the array as a variable and simply call the function, passing through our array as a parameter. 

        This is incredibly useful, as now we can reuse this function without having to write out a calculation each time.
