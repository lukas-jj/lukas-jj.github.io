      <h4>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h4>
      <p>My long term goal is to gain the skills necessary to become employed as a developer. I am especially interested in learning back-end development so that I am able to create fully working websites and applications for personal projects and freelancing.</p>
      <h4>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>
      <p>I would like to gain experience in working with teams and on group projects.</p>
      <h4>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
        should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other
        learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h4>
      <p>During the foundations section of this course, I am using a pomodoro timer and working in intervals in order to motivate myself to study full time. Towards the end of foundations I will make better use of the campus so that I am in direct contact with my cohort and facilitator. Although, I am quite enjoying using dual screens at home for coding.</p>
      <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h4>
      <p>This course provides a slack channel where it is encouraged to ask for help. I also have my facilitator, John, who has been great at answering my questions. I also have friends and family who work in the field who are able to provide help and support. </p>
      <h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h4>
      <p>I expect the facilitation team to help answer questions to the best of their ability and to provide extra support during bootcamp.</p>
      <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you
        might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h4>
      <p>My schedule was deliberately kept free in order to prioritize this course.</p>
